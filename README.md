# newxml
XML library for D with DOM compatibility. Based on the never finished experimental.xml library.

# Differences between newxml and experimental.xml

* newxml has an active development.
* newxml is GC only, for simplicity sake.
* newxml implements proper DOMString, with the option of configuring it to either UTF-8 or UTF-32 instead of the 
UTF-16, which is default in DOM.
